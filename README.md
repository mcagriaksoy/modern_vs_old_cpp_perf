## Modern vs Old C++ Functions Performance Comparison

This program compares the performance of modern, old C++ and C functions for a specific use case. The program measures the time taken by each function to perform the same task, and outputs the results to the console.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can download and install a C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang from the official websites.

Once you have a C++ compiler installed, you can download the source code for this program from the GitHub repository. You can then compile the source code using your C++ compiler.

## Usage

To use this program, simply run the files with extension .cpp. The results will be printed out to the console.

```
g++ filename.cpp

// In Linux systems:
./a.out
```

If you would like to contribute to this program, you can fork the GitHub repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
